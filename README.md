# Hearthstone Chat
Instantly chat with Hearthstone opponents that also have this application. *Only one file needs to be downloaded, no installation is required, no registration is required, no setup is required, no chat logs are stored, automatic updates.*

*For Windows Only.*

**Getting Started**

* Download the Hearthstone Chat application (only one .hta file). The icon is optional as your application's local shortcut icon.
* Open Hearthstone and the Hearthstone Chat application, in any order.
* The application will configure a Hearthstone log file if one doesn't already exist.
* Whenever you enter a new game, the application will automatically place you in a unique chat room with your opponent. If you don't see your opponent also enter the chat room, that means they don't have this application running.

**How It Works**

The application continously scans the Power.log file generated by Hearthstone. From this information, it finds you and your opponent's BattleTags and creates a unique chatID based on them. It sends this chatID to the web handler that puts you in a chatroom where only messages sent by your application with that matching chatID can be seen.

**Interface**

* Header
  * The header contains the name of your current opponent. Clicking on it copies their BattleTag to your clipboard.
  * Next to your opponent's name is a red 'block' icon. Clicking the icon will temporarily block your opponent's messages (for only this session). When you click the icon, your opponent's status icon and name will become red. You'll also see a system message in the chat room. Clicking on the now white 'block' icon again unblocks your opponent's messages and restores their status to normal.
  * Whenever you get a new message, a sound will alert by default. Click on the 'speaker' icon to toggle this sound on/off.

* Chat Room
  * Your messages are gold and remain in the chat room for 5 minutes.
  * Your opponent's message are white and remain in the chat room for 5 minutes.
  * System messages are in blue (only seen by you) and stays in the chat room for 30 seconds.
