# Hearthstone Chat
A third-party chat application for Hearthstone, instantly chat with opponents also running this application.

*One-file download. No installation required. No registration required. No setup required. No logs stored.*

**How It Works**

* Download the Hearthstone Chat application (currently for Windows only).
* Open Hearthstone and the Hearthstone Chat application, in any order.
* The application will check for and configure a Hearthstone log file if one doesn't already exist.
* Whenever you start a new game, the application will automatically place you in a unique chat room with your opponent. If you don't see your opponent also enter the chat room, that means they don't have this application running.
