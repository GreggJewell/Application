# Hearthstone Chat
A chat application for Hearthstone, instantly chat with opponents also running this application. Only one file needs to be downloaded, no installation is required, no registration is required, no setup is required, no chat logs are stored.

*For Windows Only.*

**Getting Started**

* Download the Hearthstone Chat application (only one .hta file).
* Open Hearthstone and the Hearthstone Chat application, in any order.
* The application will configure a Hearthstone log file if one doesn't already exist.
* Whenever you enter a new game, the application will automatically place you in a unique chat room with your opponent. If you don't see your opponent also enter the chat room, that means they don't have this application running.

**How It Works**

The application continously scans the Power.log file generated by Hearthstone. From this information, it finds you and your opponent's BattleTags and creates a unique chatID based on them. It sends this chatID the web handler and puts you in a chatroom that returns all messages sent by your application with that matching chatID.

**Interface**

* Header
  * The header contains the name of your current opponent. Clicking on it copies their BattleTag to your clipboard.
  * Next to your opponent's name is a red 'block' icon. Clicking the icon will temporarily block your opponent's messages (for only this session). When you click the icon, your opponent's status icon and name will become red. You'll also see a system message in the chat room. Clicking on the now white 'block' icon again unblocks your opponent's messages and restores their status to normal.
  * Whenever you get a new message, a sound will alert by default. Click on the 'speaker' icon to toggle this sound on/off.

* Chat Room
  * Your text is in gold and only appear in the chat room for 5 minutes.
  * Your opponent's text is in white and only appear in the chat room for 5 minutes.
